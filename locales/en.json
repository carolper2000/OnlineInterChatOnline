			"text": "OnlineInterChat is a chatting platform which can be either deployed locally, to allow employees of a company on a same network to discuss without the whole Internet being informed on their exchanged messages. Or it can be deployed on the Internet to allow multiple people from around the globe to discuss via the Internet and exchange on different topics. Our application is inspired from IRC and its equivalents on the fact that it's a \"session-based\" chat. Which means that no message is stored. We've made this choice firstly for data security reasons, but also because the app needs to be optimized for usage on a mobile phone. If we were to load a huge amount of messages while the page is loading, by the time the previous messages are displayed, the user may have already left the web page."
